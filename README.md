# Romeo Golf Cohort

## Introduction

This is the branch for the Romeo Golf Cohort. It is a group of students who are learning to code with a focus on frontend development. This repo is designed to house their capstone project. Romeo Golf is a pseudonym for their project: resume generator. This product will help bridge the gap between transitioning veterans and their future tech career.

## Getting Started...

 - Clone down the repo

 `git clone https://github.com/Vets-Who-Code/romeo-golf-cohort.git`
 
 - Run local host
 
 `npm start`
 
 - Create a branch

 `git checkout -b issue#/task`
 
 - Add changes to staging

 `git add .`
 
 - Commit your changes

 `git commit -m "message text here"`
 
 - Push up your commits

 `git push`
 
## Always double check your branch before running through add, commit, push. Can do that with:

`git branch` and can then check it out if you aren't in it with `git checkout issue#/task`

If you mistakenly push to Main/Master, don't fret...but use the below to remove that push and then ensure you push it up in a branch:

`git revert commitID`

The ID can be found by clicking the commit link just under the Code button dropdown, then finding your personal commit.

Once you have ran the revert command, you'll want to go back and commit that stating why you needed to revert the commit and then push it up.

This is definitely something to practice as mistakes happen all the time, and I know I have needed to do this multiple times myself.
